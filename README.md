# phCalc - A simple javascript calculator #

A simple calculator made along The Odin Project - The main idea is to mimic how the iOS calculator works : 
1. You type your first number
2. You select an operator - The operator key stays lit
3. You type your second number, the first number disappear and the new number is show on the screen
4. If you type = or ENTER the result is displayed. Same thing if you push a new operator key
